        <p>Imagine a scene:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                You are sitting at home in your small, one-room apartment in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun is setting and the air is starting to cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are making dinner for your family when you feel the
                ground start to shake.
            </p>
            <p>
                You look around in confusion as the shaking gets stronger and stronger. The walls of your home creak and
                groan as the earthquake intensifies, and the pictures on the walls rattle and fall to the ground. You
                grab your children and run outside, just as the walls of your apartment start to crumble. You huddle
                together in the street, terrified, as the earthquake continues to rage. You remember hearing that Haiti
                is located on a fault line and that earthquakes are relatively common, but you never expected one this
                strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are not alone. Millions of other Haitians are also experiencing the same thing. A magnitude 7.0
                earthquake has struck the country with devastating force, killing thousands and leaving millions more
                homeless. The damage is widespread and the recovery will be long and difficult. But even in the midst of
                this tragedy, your people are resilient. They are helping each other to rebuild their lives and
                their country, and manage the chaos of a natural disaster of this scale.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>By the numbers, this earthquake is difficult to comprehend.</p>

            Now, let's take a look at a diagram of what caused the earthquake
            (or something; I haven't figured this part out yet).
