        <p>Imagine a scene:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                You are sitting at home in your small, one-room apartment in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun is setting and the air is starting to cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are making dinner for your family when you feel the
                ground start to shake.
            </p>
            <p>
                You look around in confusion as the shaking gets stronger and stronger. The walls of your home creak and
                groan as the earthquake intensifies, and the pictures on the walls rattle and fall to the ground. You
                grab your children and run outside, just as the walls of your apartment start to crumble. You huddle
                together in the street, terrified, as the earthquake continues to rage. You remember hearing that Haiti
                is located on a fault line and that earthquakes are relatively common, but you never expected one this
                strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are not alone. Millions of other Haitians are also experiencing the same thing. A magnitude 7.0
                earthquake has struck the country with devastating force, killing thousands and leaving millions more
                homeless. The damage is widespread and the recovery will be long and difficult. But even in the midst of
                this tragedy, your people are resilient. They are helping each other to rebuild their lives and
                their country, and manage the chaos of a natural disaster of this scale.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>By the numbers, this earthquake is difficult to comprehend.</p>

            So, we have seen how, due to the earthquake, more than one million people were displaced from their homes
            and forced to live in makeshift camps . Many buildings collapsed or were severely damaged, including the
            presidential palace, the parliament, the cathedral, and dozens of hospitals and schools.

            The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a major turning point in the history of the country. It brought to light some
            deep-rooted social, economic, and political problems that had plagued Haiti for decades.

            It also highlighted the vulnerability of Haiti to natural disasters, as it lies on a fault line and is prone
            to hurricanes, floods, and landslides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, it mobilized an unprecedented global response that aimed to support the recovery and
            reconstruction of the country.

            The international community pledged billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and development assistance, and
            sent thousands of troops, police, and relief workers to help with the emergency. Many countries,
            organizations, and individuals expressed solidarity and compassion with the Haitian people, and vowed to
            help them build back better.

            However, the progress made in the past 10 years has been slow and uneven, and many challenges
            remain.

            destruction to this nation.
